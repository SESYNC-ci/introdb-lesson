## Summary

As we have seen, a database will be a core element of a centralized workflow, accomodating simultaneous use by all members of a collaborative team.
We have just skimmed the topic of **concurrency** in database interactions: there is a lot going on under the hood to prevent data corruption.

The ability to precisely define data types if the primary database feature that guaranties **reliability** in your dataset. As you develop scripts for analysis and vizualization, certainty that you'll never encounter a "NaN" when you expect an Integer will prevent, or help you catch, bugs and errors down the road.

The third major feature to motivate databae use, **scaleability**, remains for you to discover. Did you bring a large dataset? Our coaches will help you load it into the PostgreSQL server, where you will be able to witness the speed with which very large tables can be queried, sorted and combined as you work on your "data2doc" project this week.
