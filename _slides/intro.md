The Portal Project is a long-term ecological study being conducted near Portal, AZ.
Since 1977, the site has been a primary focus of research on interactions among rodents, ants and plants and their respective responses to climate.

The research site consists of many "plots" -- patches of the Arizona desert that become intensively manipulated and observed.
The plots have some fixed characteristics, such as the type of manipulation, geographic location, aspect, etc.

The plots have a lot of dynamic characteristics too, and are regularly surveyed with a particular focus on their changing species compostion.
Every survey of each plot produces a distinct set of observations that get recorded in a well-structure database, designed for reliable storage & rapid access to the bounty of information produced by this long-term ecological experiment.
