The Portal Project is a long-term ecological study being conducted near Portal, AZ.
Since 1977, the site has been a primary focus of research on interactions among rodents, ants and plants and their respective responses to climate. 
A portion of the data has become widely distributed among instructors seeking a real-world dataset on which trainees can hone their data skills.

The research site consists of many "plots" -- patches of the Arizona desert that become intensively manipulated and observed.
The plots have some fixed characteristics, such as the type of manipulation, geographic location, aspect, etc.

The plots have a lot of dynamic characteristics too, and are regularly surveyed with a particular focus on their changing species compostion.
Every survey of each plot produces a distinct set of observations to be recorded in a database.
A well-structured database has been designed to store & access the bounty of information produced by this long-term ecological experiment.
