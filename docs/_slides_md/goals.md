## What good is a database?

For a team of researchers implementing a collaborative workflow, the top reasons to use a database are:

1. **concurrency** - Multiple users can safely read and edit database entries simultaneously.
1. **reliability** - Relational databases formalize and can enforce concepts of "tidy" data.
1. **scalability** - Very large tables can be read, searched, and merged quickly.
