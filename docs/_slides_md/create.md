## Table definition

Table definition uses PostgreSQL  "CREATE TABLE" statements, as shown in the "Scripts" tab of PGStudio.

Simplified a bit, the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html) for "CREATE TABLE" follows the pattern:

```
CREATE TABLE %table% {
    %column_name% %data_type% [%option% ...],
    ...
}
```

===

## Exercise

Write the `CREATE TABLE` statement for a new "surveyors" table with fields for a "person_id", "first_name", and "last_name".

===

## Insert

## Import

requires newer pgstudio release
if compiling, could also increase timeout ...
