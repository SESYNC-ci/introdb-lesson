## Summary

Databases are a core element of a centralized workflow, accomodating simultaneous use by all members of a collaborative team.

The ability to precisely define keys and data types is the primary database feature that guaranties **reliability**. As you develop scripts for analysis and vizualization, certainty that you'll never encounter a "NaN" when you expect an Integer will prevent, or help you catch, bugs in your code.

The third major feature to motivate databae use, **scaleability**, remains for you to discover. Very large tables can be queried, sorted and combined quickly when the work is done by a powerful database system outside of R.
